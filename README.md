👨‍💻 Embedded Systems Engineer | Hardware Whisperer | Code Meets Circuitry
Hi, I'm Kostas, a passionate embedded engineer who thrives at the intersection of hardware and software. I specialize in designing robust, efficient, and scalable embedded systems that power real-world applications.

🔧 What I Do
🛠️ Develop firmware for microcontrollers (ARM-based architecture)

📡 Integrate sensors, actuators, and communication protocols (UART, SPI, I2C, CAN, BLE)

⚙️ Design and debug PCBs using KiCad, Altium, and EasyEDA

🧪 Optimize real-time systems for performance and reliability

🧠 Tinker with RTOS, low-level drivers, and bare-metal programming

🚀 Projects You'll Find Here
Custom PCB designs with full schematics and BOMs

Firmware for IoT devices and industrial controllers

🌱 Always Learning
I’m constantly exploring new architectures, improving my C/C++ chops, and diving into Rust for embedded. I believe in clean code, modular design, and sharing knowledge.
